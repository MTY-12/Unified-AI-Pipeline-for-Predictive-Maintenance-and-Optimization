# Branch-Based Workflow for Unified AI Pipeline ðŸŒ²

## 1. Main Branch Setup
- Ensure you are on the `main` branch and it is up to date:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  ```

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement Predictive Maintenance with Neural Network and Decision Tree"
```
#### Push Branch
```bash
git push -u origin predictive-maintenance
```
#### Merge into Main
- Switch to `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout main

## 7. Additional Git Commands Used
- **Check Current Branch**:
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```
- **Check Remote URL**:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
- **Change Remote URL**:
  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin <new-repository-url>
  ```
- **Remove Remote**:
  ```bash
  git remote remove origin
  ```
- **Initialize Repository**:
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
- **Clone Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```

## Summary ðŸŒŸ
- **Always create a branch** for each topic or feature.
- **Regularly commit and push** changes to avoid losing work.
- **Merge completed work** into the `main` branch.
- **Delete branches** after merging to keep the repository clean.

This workflow ensures organized and efficient progress across different project tasks!
